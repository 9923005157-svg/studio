# **App Name**: PharmaTrust

## Core Features:

- IoT Data Logging: Logistics and environmental IoT sensor data (temperature, humidity, location, pressure) directly into the system.
- Blockchain Integration: Securely store transaction and sensor data on a distributed ledger to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering.
- User Role Management: Implement role-based access control for different stakeholders: FDA, Manufacturer, Distributor, Pharmacy, and Patient.
- Traceability Dashboard: Provide a visual dashboard for all stakeholders to track the drug's journey from origin to patient, including IoT data and transaction history.
- Alerting System: Trigger alerts for anomalies such as temperature deviations or unauthorized transfers, recorded immutably.
- Smart Contract Automation: Automate FDA approvals and repackaging processes using smart contracts, ensuring compliance and efficiency.
- Predictive Anomaly Detection: Utilize an AI-powered tool to analyze IoT and blockchain data, predicting potential anomalies and risks in the supply chain before they occur. The LLM is a tool because it decides when information should be raised as an anomaly based on learned patterns.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#293462), evoking trust and security in the pharmaceutical supply chain.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#D5DBE8), providing a clean, professional backdrop that is easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Bright cyan (#00BFFF), used for interactive elements and key data points, to draw attention to critical information.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif to create a clean tech feel. Body Font: 'Inter' for body text.
- Use clean, consistent line icons to represent different stages of the supply chain and data points from IoT sensors.
- Employ a grid-based layout to present data in a clear, organized manner, making it easy for stakeholders to track and understand the information.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as smooth loading indicators and animated data visualizations.
